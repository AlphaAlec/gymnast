<li>Rows</li>

<li>Resized columns (for responsive queries)</li>
<li>Shifted left and right columns</li>

<h1 id="how-to-use">How to use</h1>
<p>Take _gymnast.scss and include it with your stylesheets. You can either import it to your main scss style sheet or copy and paste the code in.</p>
<p>There are four sections to the gymnast grid: rows, columns, shifted columns, and block grids. Each section is made up of two parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mixins: the base of the Gymnast grid, and may be used for a completely custom grid approach</li>
<li>Classes: the tools needed for an easy to use, out of the box experience, with more shared, and less repeated CSS</li>
</ol>
