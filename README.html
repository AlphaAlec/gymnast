<p>Take _grid.scss and include it with your stylesheets. You can either import it to your main scss style sheet or copy and paste the code in.</p>
<p>There are three sections to the gymnast grid.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Grid Variables: set your site variables, such a column gutter padding and the site&#39;s max width.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grid Mixins: this is where the main mixins can be found. If you&#39;re going to do a pure mixin build, this is the section for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CSS Ready Mixins and Classes: here you can find modified versions of the main mixins and classes you can add to your html for plug and play goodness.</p>
