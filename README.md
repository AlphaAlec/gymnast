# Gymnast

Gymnast is a simple SCSS grid designed for semantic and responsive css, inspired by Semantic.gs and Zurb's Foundation.

# What's Included

Grid Variables: this is where you set your site variables, such the gutter, the site's max width and the number of columns you want for your grid.

The Gymnast Grid includes mixins and css ready classes for the following:
1. Rows
2. Columns 
3. Resized columns (for responsive queries)
4. Shifted left and right columns
5. Block grids
6. Block grid resets (for responsive queries)

# How to use

Take _gymnast.scss and include it with your stylesheets. You can either import it to your main scss style sheet or copy and paste the code in.

There are four sections to the gymnast grid: rows, columns, shifted columns, and block grids. Each section is made up of two parts.

1. Mixins: the base of the Gymnast grid, and may be used for a completely custom grid approach
2. Classes: the tools needed for an easy to use, out of the box experience, with more shared, and less repeated CSS
