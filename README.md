# Gymnast v1

Gymnast is a simple framework that provides a library of mixins and css ready classes, offering a broad use spectrum and multiple responsive options.

# What's Included

The Gymnast Grid includes rows, columns, resized columns (for responsive), shifted columns, block grids and block grid resets (for responsive).

# How to use

Take _grid.scss and include it with your stylesheets. You can either import it to your main scss style sheet or copy and paste the code in.

There are three sections to the gymnast grid.

1. Grid Variables: set your site variables, such a column gutter padding and the site's max width.

2. Grid Mixins: this is where the main mixins can be found. If you're going to do a pure mixin build, this is the section for you.

3. CSS Ready Mixins and Classes: here you can find modified versions of the main mixins and classes you can add to your html for plug and play goodness.

# In action

Examples of all Gymnast's features can be found in index.html and styles.scss
